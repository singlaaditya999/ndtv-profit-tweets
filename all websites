A total of 1,31,281 passenger cars were sold in the country last month, marking a fall of 33.40 per cent compared to the corresponding period a year ago, the SIAM data showed.
A total of 20,04,932 passenger as well as commercial vehicles were sold in September, marking a fall of 22.41 per cent, while production decreased 18.29 per cent to 2,406,640 units. That included passenger vehicles, utility vehicles, vans, two- and three wheelers and commercial vehicles.
The car and utility vehicles segment was largely impacted by slowing economy, low consumer sentiment, floods in key markets, a drop in rural demand and increase in insurance cost, SIAM said in a presentation. 
"We are preparing for best-case and worst-case scenarios ... worst case there will be more production and job cuts," said SIAM president Rajan Wadhera.
Two wheeler sales in the domestic market dropped 22.09 per cent year-on-year to 1,656,774 in September, it showed.
Total sales of commercial vehicles - including light, medium and heavy carriers of passengers and goods - fell 39.06 per cent to 58,419 units, according to SIAM. 
In the first six months of current financial year, a total of 1,66,45,330 vehicles were produced. That included passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, two- and three-wheelers, and quadri-cycles, and marked a fall of 13.32 per cent over the corresponding period a year ago.
Exports of utility vehicles, however, increased 28.75 per cent to 13,235 units in September. That led to a 5.64 per cent rise in total passenger vehicle exports to 61,333 units, SIAM data showed. 
Car and auto component makers have cut lakhs of jobs and halted some production as the industry grapples with various challenges amid a broader economic slowdown. The government stepped in last month, announcing a corporate tax cut to boost manufacturing and lift growth.
The auto industry is getting ready for the implementation of BS-6 emission norms, SIAM said. It urged oil companies to make BS-6 fuel available across the country from February 1.

A taxpayer is eligible to receive an income tax refund in case excess tax is paid either through tax deduction on payments made to him/her or direct tax payments as advance or self assessment tax.
Individuals can check income tax status through the website tin.tin.nsdl.com by entering the Permanent Account Number (PAN) and selecting the relevant assessment year. 
One can track the refund status by logging on to the income tax e-filing website - incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in - by clicking on the "Refund/Demand Status" option under the "My Account" tab. The refund status is also reflected in Form 26AS, which is the tax credit statement summarising the taxes paid by an individual to the Income Tax Department.
If the refund status shows as "expired", it means that the refund cheque received by the taxpayer was not deposited in the bank within the stipulated time. The validity of a cheque is 90 days. In such a scenario, the taxpayer is required to request a refund re-issue, according to NSDL.
In case the return was filed electronically, a reissue request may be raised online by logging into the e-filing portal. 
In other cases, for a re-initiation of refund, the taxpayer is required to contact the Assessing Officer under whose jurisdiction the return was filed.
In case the refund status shows as "ECS" (electronic clearing service), the taxpayer is required to request a reissue by providing the correct bank details.
If the refund status mentions that the refund was processed though NECS/NEFT which failed, the taxpayer is required to verify the account number, account description and the MICR/IFSC code provided at the time of filing of return. The taxpayer may contact the Assessing Officer for modification in account details and re-issuance of refund. 
If the status shows that the refund was processed through direct credit which failed, it means that the bank had initiated the credit of refund amount but the transfer failed.
This happens when the credit of refund fails due to a closed account or when the operations in the account are stopped or restricted. It also happens in case of a non-resident Indian (NRI) account or in case the account holder has deceased.

The SGB scheme comprises government securities denominated in gold wherein investors are required to pay the issue price in cash. The bonds are redeemed in cash on maturity.
SGB is restricted for sale to resident individuals, HUFs (Hindu Undivided Families), trusts, universities and charitable institutions, according to RBI.
The price of bond is fixed in rupees on the basis of a simple average of closing price of gold of 99.9 per cent purity, published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Limited for the last three working days of the week preceding the subscription period.  
The bonds bear interest from the date of issue at the rate of 2.50 per cent (fixed rate) per annum on the nominal value. 
Cash, demand draft, cheque and electronic banking (net banking) are allowed as modes of payment for investment in the gold bonds.
The tenor of the bond is for a period of eight years with exit option after fifth year to be exercised on the interest payment dates.
The minimum permissible amount allowed for investment in SGB is one gram of gold.
The maximum limit of the subscription is four kilograms for individuals and HUFs, and 20 kilograms for trusts and similar entities per fiscal year (April-March), which is notified by the government from time to time.
Bonds are tradable on stock exchanges within a fortnight of the issuance on a date as notified by the RBI.

TITLE:
Credit Growth Enters Single-Digit Lane As Slump Spreads


Content:
Credit growth rate to the services sector more than halved to 13.3 per cent in August.Content:
Reflecting the deepening economic crisis arising from both structural and cyclical issues and a massive fall in consumption demand, bank credit growth rate, for the first time this financial year, slowed to single digit at 8.8 per cent to Rs 97.71 lakh crore during the fortnight to September 27, according the Reserve Bank of India data.Content:
In the first fortnight of the fiscal ending April 12, the credit demand grew 14.19 per cent after closing the previous fiscal at 13.24 per cent. Throughout this fiscal so far, credit growth has been in the low-double-digit.Content:
On Thursday, global rating agency Moody's slashed its GDP growth forecast to 5.8 per cent from 6.2 per cent earlier. The downward revision came in after the first quarter GDP printed at a six-year low of 5 per cent forcing a "surprised" RBI to massively slash its forecast by a full 80 basis points to 6.1 per cent within a span of just two months and by 140 basis points from its April forecast.Content:
Since the Q1 GDP, there has not been any positive data coming out, barring inflation, which remains tamed. Be it IIP numbers or exports or core sector data, everything has been heading south month after month. On top of it, tax collections, both direct and indirect, have also been sprinting down.Content:
While income tax collection during the first half just inched up 5 per cent against a budgeted estimate of 17.5 per cent, the all important GST collection has never touched the desired Rs 1-lakh-crore-mark barring in April.Content:
Amidst all these negative news flows, the government has given away as much as Rs 1.45 lakh crore to the corporates by way of a massive reduction in corporate tax rates with retrospective effect from April 1, putting a big question mark on the government ability to meet the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent.Content:
Slashing the growth forecast, Moody's said the economy is experiencing a pronounced slowdown which is partly related to long-lasting factors. New IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva earlier this week opined that India is experiencing "more pronounced" effect of the global downturn.Content:
Credit demand has slowed to single digit as the mainstay of banks-personal loans and demand from services sector lost their momentum. While credit growth rate to the services sector more than halved to 13.3 per cent in August from 26.7 per cent a year ago, personal loans growth also moderated to 15.6 per cent in August from 18.2 per cent in August 2018.Content:
The only silver lining was demand from the industry, which more than doubled to 3.9 per cent in August from 1.9 per cent in August 2018.Content:
In the fortnight to September 27, deposits growth too slowed to 9.38 per cent to Rs 129.06 lakh crore from Rs 118lakh crore a year ago. On annualized basis, non-food credit growth decelerated to 9.8 per cent in August 2019 from 12.4 per cent in August 2018. Loans to agriculture & allied activities increased 6.8 per cent in August compared to an increase of 6.6 per cent last year same month.Content:

RBI Central Board Reviews Economic Situation, Co-Operative Banks


Content:
The RBI has lowered GDP growth projections for the current fiscal to 6.1%.Content:
The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Central Board met in Chandigarh on Friday and reviewed the current economic situation, global and domestic challenges and various areas of operation of the central bank as economic slowdown becomes more pronounced and the latest manipulation of loans at PMC Bank flags off a new threat to banking governance and NPA frauds while depositors are left in lurch.Content:
"The Board was also informed about the formation of the Strategy Sub-Committee of the Central Board of Directors," the RBI said.Content:
The Board reviewed the current economic situation, global and domestic challenges and various areas of operation of the Reserve Bank.Content:
In this context, the Board also discussed in detail the current state of the financial sector with special focus on the regulatory and supervisory architecture of commercial banks and also NBFCs.Content:
The RBI Central Board met amidst weak growth estimates by global agencies and the RBI itself and also the recent fraud at the PMC Bank triggering questions if the current laws on cooperative banks are enough to check frauds and protect common man's money in them.Content:
On Thursday, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh, without taking PMC Bank's name, said it is "brutally unfair" that they have regular loan waivers and corporate loan write-offs but no financial system to protect the common man's savings.Content:
"To my mind, there is no greater cardinal sin in finance than misuse of the common man's hard earned savings. It seems brutally unfair that we have allowed a system of loan waivers and write-offs every now and again, but yet we do not have a robust enough financial system to protect the honest common man's savings," Mr Parekh said while launching a centre for financial studies by B-school S.P. Jain.Content:
The RBI has already lowered GDP growth projections for the current fiscal to 6.1 per cent. On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service slashed its 2019-20 GDP growth forecast for India to 5.8 per cent from 6.2 per cent earlier, saying the economy was experiencing a pronounced slowdown which is partly related to long-lasting factors.Content:
Moody's attributed the deceleration to an investment-led slowdown that has broadened into consumption, driven by financial stress among rural households and weak job creation. The IMF had pared down its 2019-20 growth forecast for India in July by 30 basis points to 7 per cent, expecting weaker domestic demand to limit an economic recovery.Content:

TITLE:
Jio Voice Charges May Improve Incumbents' Revenues: CARE


Content:
Relince Jio cited paying Rs 13,500 crore IUC to other telcos.Content:
Reliance Jio's move to charge voice calls at 6 paise a minute to other networks may improve the revenues for incumbents, CARE Ratings said on Friday.Content:
"Reliance Jio's move to recover IUC from the customers points out that the telco aims to increase its ARPU (average revenue per user) and now charge for the voice call services provided free earlier. This will also provide room to the incumbents in the industry to improve their ARPU," CARE Ratings said.Content:
Incumbents have been hit hard due to Jio's free voice calls over the last three years and their ARPUs have dipped significantly, and so have their revenues and profitability. Bharti Airtel posted a Q1 loss of Rs 2,866 crore and its ARPU just increased 5.1 percent at Rs 129 versus Rs 123 in the last quarter.Content:
The agency said another reason that is believed to have prompted this action by Reliance Jio (to charge voice calls to other networks) is the higher percentage of outgoing Minutes of Usage (MoU) from its network to other networks (referred as outgoing off-net) compared to the percentage of incoming MoU from other networks to its network (referred as incoming off-net).Content:
The higher off-net outgoing MoUs indicate the higher IUC paid by a particular telco to another operator for terminating a call over the other telcos' network. From the chart, it can be seen that the off-net outgoing MoUs are higher for Reliance Jio compared to the incumbents and is also higher compared to its off-net incoming MoUs. The off-net outgoing MoUs however is reducing for Reliance Jio sequentially and the company stated that in the last three years, it has paid nearly Rs 13,500 crore as net IUC charges to the other operators from its own resources.Content:
Relince Jio cited paying Rs 13,500 crore IUC to other telcos and uncertainty of TRAI's timeline on IUC phase out as the main reasons behind its decision to charge voice calls to other networks.Content:

Every Diwali, you buy new outfits for yourself and your family, invest in gold for your future and buy gifts for friends and relatives. So, why not give your home a dazzling makeover too? Home renovation not only makes your home visually appealing, but also adds to the comfort it offers and increases its worth. However, remodelling expenses can run into several lakhs, which can often be beyond one's budget. Fortunately, with a personal loan for home renovation, you can give your home a sparkling new look without any financial stress.Content:
Take a closer look at how you can renovate your home this Diwali using such a personal loan.Content:

With guests frequenting your home during Diwali, serving up delicious food is a given. However, to enhance your efficiency in the kitchen, you can switch to smart fittings and a modular cooking range. Choose vanity sinks, vintage drawers or cabinets, and brass fixtures for aesthetics and functionality. Invest in your kitchen's countertops and make them ergonomic and easy to work on. Buy a dishwasher and a powerful exhaust chimney to maintain hygiene too. You can also invest in cookware that doubles up as serving ware, as well as a range of festive crockery and cutlery.Content:

Diwali is rightfully regarded as the festival of lights, and you can take the theme to heart by lighting up your interiors smartly. No matter whether your home's design theme is all about monochrome minimalism or baroque luxury, you can find chandeliers, sconces, table lamps, lanterns, hanging pendant lights and floor lamps to match. What's more, you can replace your old electrical fixtures with smart lights that you can control with your smartphone!Content:
Apart from buying all new furniture and upholstery for the rooms in your home, also consider giving your appliances an upgrade. From smart TVs and refrigerators to dishwashers, inverter ACs and a powerful washing machine, you can finance your home renovation with a personal loan in combination with seasonal discounts to purchase appliances will make chores easier for you not only during the busy festive season, but all year round.Content:

If you have always wanted to turn the grounds attached to your home into a garden, use funds from the loan to do now.

To make these changes and others that you have on your list, be it repainting the entire home exteriors and interiors, redoing the washrooms, or adding another wing, choose a feature-rich personal loan. When scouting for the right personal loan for home renovation, look for a lender that offers usage flexibility and ease of repayment too. Bajaj Finserv is one such reputed lender that offers a hefty sanction of up to Rs 25 lakh quickly, and at competitive personal loan interest rates. To make repayment easy, it allows you to repay your loan over a flexible tenor ranging up to 60 months. You can simply use the personal loan calculator to determine affordable EMIs and select the right tenor accordingly.Content:
In addition, you can also avail a flexi personal loan. This facility allows you to make multiple withdrawals to meet renovation expenses in phases, and pay interest only on the utilised amount. You can also manage your cash flow better by paying interest-only EMIs throughout the tenor and repaying the principal at the end.Content:
To kickstart your home renovation plans without further delay, be sure to check your pre-approved personal loan offer from Bajaj Finserv first. Get a deal that matches your needs and access funds instantly this Diwali!Content:
