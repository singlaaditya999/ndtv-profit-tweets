      "TITLE:": "IMF Says Corporate Income Tax Cut Will Help Revive Investment In India",
      "content": "The International Monetary Fund on Friday supported India's recent decision to reduce corporate income tax, saying it has a positive impact on investment. It, however, said India should address continued fiscal consolidation and secure long-term stability of the fiscal conditions.\"We believe India still has limited fiscal space so they have to be careful. We support their corporate income tax cut because it has a positive impact on investment,\" Changyong Rhee, Director, Asia and Pacific Department, IMF, told reporters at a news conference here.Following a marked slowdown in the last two quarters in India, the economy is expected to grow at 6.1 per cent this fiscal year, picking up to 7.0 per cent in 2020, he said.\"The monetary policy stimulus and the announced corporate income tax cut are expected to help revive investment,\" said the top IMF official. Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf, Deputy Director, Asia and Pacific Department, IMF, said India should address the non-bank financial sector issues.\"While there have been improvements that have been put in motion, including efforts to recapitalise the state banks, the issue of non-bank financial institution remains partly unresolved and regulatory equity is one of the issues that needs to be achieved,\" she said.The government is aware of it, she added. \"We also had a FSAP. So there are issues working at that and this is something that is why not yet fully achieved, but is entrained. While there are problems at this stage, increased attention to lending practices of non-bank financial institutions continue to be very important,\" Gulde-Wolf said.Responding to a question, she said India overall has a fairly high level of debt and fiscal consolidation needs to be a priority. \"However, implementing fiscal consolidation in the context of a federal system is much more complicated. The level of fiscal structural issues and challenges are different in different states,\" she said.So one of the ways in which the IMF is engaged in this question is it has a regional training institute that has started working with the individual states on strengthening fiscal management at the state level, Gulde-Wolf said.In the context of surveillance engagement with India, she said, the IMF is increasingly placing emphasis on the need to better coordinate the fiscal state level activities and fiscal activities. \"But it is a concern that the authorities are taking serious and are working at,\" Gulde-Wolf said.Follow NDTV for latest election news and live coverage of assembly elections 2019 in Maharashtra and Haryana.Subscribe to our YouTube\u00a0channel, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram for latest news and live news updates.................................

      "content": "In the wake of a number of resignations in listed companies off late, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday floated stricter disclosure norms for resignation of auditors.In a circular, the regulator said that listed entities should disclose the detailed reasons to stock exchanges in case of resignation of its auditor within 24 hours of receiving the reasons from the auditor.\"Sub-clause (7A) inserted under Clause A in Part A of Schedule III under Regulation 30(2)of SEBI LODR Regulations requires detailed reasons to be disclosed by the listed entities to the stock exchanges in case of resignation of the auditor of a listed entity as soon as possible but not later than twenty-four hours of receipt of such reasons from the auditor,\" it said.Further, the directive said the audit committee of a listed entity has to make recommendations for the appointment, remuneration and terms of appointment of the auditors.\"Under Sub-clause (7), the Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and monitoring the independence and performance of auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process,\" it said.It also said, Regulation 36(5) of the Sebi's norms lays down certain disclosures to be made part of the notice to the shareholders for an annual general meeting, where the statutory auditors are proposed to be appointed or re-appointed, including their terms of appointment.\"Resignation of an auditor of a listed entity/its material subsidiary before completion of the audit of the financial results for the year due to reasons such as pre-occupation may seriously hamper investor confidence and deny them access to reliable information for taking timely investment decisions.\"In the past two years, listed companies have seen a slew of auditor resignations, and in some cases, they have come just few weeks ahead of the announcement of financial results. The auditor resignations have in these cases cited reasons ranging from lack of information, to mutual exits.The Sebi said that if the auditor resigns within 45 days from the end of a quarter of a financial year, then the auditor shall, before such resignation, issue the limited review or audit report for such quarter.Further, if the auditor resigns after 45 days from the end of a quarter of a financial year, then the auditor shall, before such resignation, issue the limited review or audit report for such quarter as well as the next quarter.\"If the auditor has signed the limited review/audit report for the first three quarters of a financial year, then the auditor shall, before such resignation, issue the limited review/audit report for the last quarter of such financial year as well as the audit report for such financial year,\" Sebi said.Follow NDTV for latest election news and live coverage of assembly elections 2019 in Maharashtra and Haryana.Subscribe to our YouTube\u00a0channel, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram for latest news and live news updates.................................

      "content": "The RBI this month cut rates by 25 basis points as expectedThe Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee favours cutting interest rates and continuing with an accommodative stance until the economy is firmly on a recovery path, its minutes showed.A significant moderation in domestic demand at a time when inflation is seen staying well within mandated targets provides adequate monetary policy space to support economic growth, according to the central bank minutes released on Friday.The RBI this month cut rates by 25 basis points as expected, taking cumulative cuts to 135 basis points so far in 2019.Retail inflation rose close to the RBI's medium-term target of 4 per cent in September for the first time in 14 months but is expected to remain well within the mandated 2-6 per cent\u00a0band until first quarter of 2020-21 as per its projections.The economy grew at its weakest pace since 2013 in the June quarter, expanding just 5 per cent, as consumer demand and government spending slowed amid the global trade frictions.\"This pronounced cyclical downswing suggests that the state of the economy will likely get worse before it gets better,\" said Michael Patra, executive director and committee member,\u00a0RBI.The government\u00a0has in recent weeks announced measures including a cut in corporate tax rates, steps to revive the crisis-hit autos sector, small businesses and its troubled shadow banks to calm investor nerves and lift consumer sentiment.The fiscal measures have raised concerns of missing a fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent for the year ending March 2020 but the finance minister has assured markets they will meet the target.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, however, said there is a need to be watchful of the fiscal situation.The central bank at its policy review also lowered its growth forecast for the current fiscal year to 6.1 per cent from 6.9 per cent and most members suggested the recovery in growth may take longer than previous expected.\"Monetary policy... cannot be a permanent form of stimulus... further monetary policy action will depend on the evolving growth-inflation dynamics,\" member Chetan Ghate said.Follow NDTV for latest election news and live coverage of assembly elections 2019 in Maharashtra and Haryana.Subscribe to our YouTube\u00a0channel, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram for latest news and live news updates.................................

The refund status is also reflected in Form 26AS,\u00a0which is the tax credit statement summarising the taxes paid by an individual to the Income Tax Department.If the refund\u00a0status shows as \"expired\", it means that the refund cheque received by the taxpayer was not deposited in the bank within the stipulated time. The validity of a cheque is 90 days. In such a scenario, the taxpayer is required to request a refund re-issue, according to NSDL.In case the return was filed electronically, a reissue request may be raised online by logging\u00a0into the e-filing portal.\u00a0In other cases, for a re-initiation of refund, the taxpayer is required to contact the Assessing Officer under whose jurisdiction the return was filed.In case the refund\u00a0status shows as \"ECS\" (electronic clearing service), the taxpayer is required to request a reissue by providing the correct bank details.If the refund status mentions that the refund was processed though NECS/NEFT which failed, the taxpayer is required to verify the account number, account description and the MICR/IFSC code provided at the time of filing of return. The taxpayer may contact the Assessing Officer for modification in account details and re-issuance\u00a0of refund.\u00a0If the status shows that the refund was processed through direct credit which failed, it means that the bank\u00a0had initiated the credit of refund amount but the transfer failed.This happens when the credit of refund fails due to a closed account or when the operations in the account are stopped or restricted. It also happens in case of a non-resident Indian (NRI) account or in case the account holder has deceased.ISRO Releases Chandrayaan-2's First Illuminated Image of the Lunar SurfaceWatch: Kohli's Hilarious Reaction To South Africa's Proxy Captain At TossAmitabh Bachchan Goes Home Three Days After HospitalisationRs. 409 Crore Receipts Found In Multi-City Raids On Spiritual Guru \"Kalki Bhagwan\"4.25 Crores Cash Found In Raids On Karnataka Congress Leader: Officials\"Will Rectify If There's Any Fault\": Karnataka Congress Leader Amid Raids5 Arrested In UP Hindu Group Leader's Killing, Suspects On CCTV MissingMaharashtra Election 2019: Soaked In Rain, Sharad Pawar Admits \"Mistake\" At Rally In Party BastionMaharashtra Elections 2019: Salman Khan's Bodyguard Shera Joins Shiv SenaJohnson & Johnson Recalls Baby Powder After Tests Show Asbestos In Sample\"Pressure Is On Pak\": Army Chief On Terror Funding Watchdog FATF's MoveDelhi Metro Services To Begin At 4 am On Sunday For Half-MarathonRs. 409 Crore Receipts Found In Multi-City Raids On Spiritual Guru \"Kalki Bhagwan\"Watch: Near Bengaluru, First Detention Centre For \"Illegal Foreigners\"Karnataka Students Made To Wear Cartons To Stop Them From CheatingAbout UsAdvertiseArchivesAppsCareersChannelsDisclaimerFeedbackInvestorsOmbudsmanRedressalsService Terms News Business  \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 MOVIES CRICKET Food Tech Auto Trains Art & DesignTweet!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) return;js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=213741912058651\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Add to Flipboard Magazine.",

Amazon cannot and does not participate in seller's decision related to their products and its prices.\"\"Flipkart is fully compliant with all laws of the country including FDI regulations.

      "content": "Very few financial institutions -- just 14 per cent -- believe they are innovation pioneers.Digital transformation has a long way to go as only 17 per cent of banks globally have succeeded in digitally transforming at scale, according to a new report released on Thursday by Infosys Finacle and non-profit organisation Efma.Legacy technology and system integration challenges are perceived as the biggest barriers to digital transformation, followed by time and cost required to bring concept to reality, said the report titled ''Innovation in Retail Banking.''More than 350 banks and financial services companies globally took part in the report authored by Jim Marous, publisher of the Digital Banking Report and co-publisher of The Financial Brand.It said majority of banks are not confident about how digital transformation has successfully impacted their organisational objectives. Only 39 per cent of banks believe their digital transformation strategy has had high or very high impact in accelerating product and service delivery and 33 per cent say it has helped enhance innovation processes.Very few financial institutions -- just 14 per cent -- believe they are innovation pioneers. Nearly 51 per cent admit to being mainstream or lagging in innovation, said the report.While banks expect mobility, advanced analytics and open banking application programming interfaces (APIs) to impact their business the most in the coming year, most are not ready to apply these technologies to create expected business outcomes.Results from the study suggest that in the next five years, the biggest threat to banking industry will be from large technology companies, fintech startups and challenger banks. More than 75 per cent of banks think that consumer technology giants and fintech firms will leadbanking innovation.At the same time, customer experience is expected to see the maximum evolution over the next three years.\"Banks will need to transform culture, organisation design, operations and technology ecosystem,\" said Sanat Rao, Chief Business Officer and Global Head at Infosys Finacle. \"The secret sauce lies in doing all of this successfully and simultaneously.\"However, said Efma Chief Executive Officer Vincent Bastid, all players in the industry -- whether it be banks, fintech start-ups, or technology companies -- understand that in the midst of increasing digital transformation in financial services, placing the customer experience at the centre is critical to success.Infosys Finacle is part of EdgeVerve Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infosys. Efma was established in 1971 by banks and insurance companies to facilitate networking between decision-makers.\u00a0Follow NDTV for latest election news and live coverage of assembly elections 2019 in Maharashtra and Haryana.Subscribe to our YouTube\u00a0channel, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram for latest news and live news updates.................................

Other demands include recovery of bad loans, stringent\u00a0action on defaulters\u00a0charges and job security, according to the statement.\u00a0Last month, four unions of public sector bank officers - the All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), the All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA), the Indian National Bank Officers' Congress (INBOC) and the National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO) - had called for a strike opposing the merger of banks. However, the strike was later deferred after Union Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar assured the unions the government would look into their demands.According to the mega consolidation plan announced in August, Punjab National Bank will be merged with United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce; Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank; Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank, and Andhra Bank with Corporation Bank and Union Bank of India.The merger to combine 10 state-run banks into four follows the amalgamation of six of SBI's associate banks along with Bharatiya Mahila Bank with the country's largest lender in 2017, and the combination of\u00a0Vijaya Bank, Dena Bank and Bank of Baroda the next year.Meanwhile,\u00a0the Finance Ministry\u00a0has said that loans worth Rs. 81,781 crore were disbursed during the nine-day outreach programme organised by banks. The loan camps were aimed at meeting the demand of borrowers during the festival season.The government expects GDP growth to pick up in the October-March period as consumer demand improves in the festival season.ISRO Releases Chandrayaan-2's First Illuminated Image of the Lunar SurfaceWatch: Kohli's Hilarious Reaction To South Africa's Proxy Captain At TossAmitabh Bachchan Goes Home Three Days After HospitalisationBanking Operations May Be Hit On October 22 Due To Strike: Bank Of BarodaBanks To Remain Closed On These Days In October, Check Full ListState-Run Banks To Remain Shut For Two Days This Week As Strike Deferred5 Arrested In UP Hindu Group Leader's Killing, Suspects On CCTV MissingMaharashtra Election 2019: Soaked In Rain, Sharad Pawar Admits \"Mistake\" At Rally In Party BastionMaharashtra Elections 2019: Salman Khan's Bodyguard Shera Joins Shiv SenaJohnson & Johnson Recalls Baby Powder After Tests Show Asbestos In SampleKarnataka Students Made To Wear Cartons To Stop Them From CheatingRs. 409 Crore Receipts Found In Multi-City Raids On Spiritual Guru \"Kalki Bhagwan\"Watch: Near Bengaluru, First Detention Centre For \"Illegal Foreigners\"Delhi Metro Services To Begin At 4 am On Sunday For Half-Marathon\"Pressure Is On Pak\": Army Chief On Terror Funding Watchdog FATF's MoveAbout UsAdvertiseArchivesAppsCareersChannelsDisclaimerFeedbackInvestorsOmbudsmanRedressalsService Terms News Business  \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940 MOVIES CRICKET Food Tech Auto Trains Art & DesignTweet!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");(function(d, s, id) {var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) return;js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.5&appId=213741912058651\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Add to Flipboard Magazine.",

      "TITLE:": "Give Your Home A Sparkling New Look This Diwali With A Personal Loan",
      "content": "Every Diwali, you buy new outfits for yourself and your family, invest in gold for your future and buy gifts for friends and relatives. So, why not give your home a dazzling makeover too? Home renovation not only makes your home visually appealing, but also adds to the comfort it offers and increases its worth. However, remodelling expenses can run into several lakhs, which can often be beyond one's budget. Fortunately, with a personal loan for home renovation, you can give your home a sparkling new look without any financial stress.Take a closer look at how you can renovate your home this Diwali using such a personal loan.With guests frequenting your home during Diwali, serving up delicious food is a given. However, to enhance your efficiency in the kitchen, you can switch to smart fittings and a modular cooking range. Choose vanity sinks, vintage drawers or cabinets, and brass fixtures for aesthetics and functionality. Invest in your kitchen's countertops and make them ergonomic and easy to work on. Buy a dishwasher and a powerful exhaust chimney to maintain hygiene too. You can also invest in cookware that doubles up as serving ware, as well as a range of festive crockery and cutlery.Diwali is rightfully regarded as the festival of lights, and you can take the theme to heart by lighting up your interiors smartly. No matter whether your home's design theme is all about monochrome minimalism or baroque luxury, you can find chandeliers, sconces, table lamps, lanterns, hanging pendant lights and floor lamps to match. What's more, you can replace your old electrical fixtures with smart lights that you can control with your smartphone!Apart from buying all new furniture and upholstery for the rooms in your home, also consider giving your appliances an upgrade. From smart TVs and refrigerators to dishwashers, inverter ACs and a powerful washing machine, you can finance your home renovation with a personal loan in combination with seasonal discounts to purchase appliances will make chores easier for you not only during the busy festive season, but all year round.If you have always wanted to turn the grounds attached to your home into a garden, use funds from the loan to do now. You can create a stone pathway leading to your garden and even add a small garage for your car. Gazebo or garden furniture will further complete the look along with a plethora of plants. Not only will this add to the appeal of your home, but also give you more space to entertain guests this festive season. To make the best use of the space, consider hiring a landscaper.To make these changes and others that you have on your list, be it repainting the entire home exteriors and interiors, redoing the washrooms, or adding another wing, choose a feature-rich personal loan. When scouting for the right personal loan for home renovation, look for a lender that offers usage flexibility and ease of repayment too. Bajaj Finserv is one such reputed lender that offers a hefty sanction of up to Rs 25 lakh quickly, and at competitive personal loan interest rates.

Founded in 1988 by Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy, NDTV is today the most watched, credible and respected news network in India and a leader in Internet. From the path-breaking \u201cThe World This Week\u201d (nominated as one of India\u2019s 5 best television programmes since Independence), the first private news on Doordarshan \u201cThe News Tonight\u201d, producing India\u2019s first 24-hour news channel \u201cStar News\u201d and the country\u2019s first ever 2-in-1 channel Profit-Prime, NDTV has been at the forefront of every single news revolution.
